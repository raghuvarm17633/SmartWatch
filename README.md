   The global smartwatch market is expected to grow at a significant rate in the coming years, driven by factors such as increasing health awareness, growing demand for wearable devices, and 
          rising disposable incomes. This growth is expected to lead to a decrease in smart watch prices, as manufacturers compete to gain market share.
 According to a report by Statista, the average price of a smartwatch is expected to decrease from $213.70 in 2023 to $198.30 by 2027. This represents a CAGR of -2.68%.
 However, it is important to note that the price of a smartwatch can vary significantly depending on the brand, features, and design.
